# Release Manifest — Version 1.2.0  
## Graceful Shutdown & Production Readiness

---

##  Release Overview

**Version:** `v1.2.0`  
**Codename:** Graceful Shutdown  
**Release Type:** Minor (Backward Compatible)  
**Focus:** Stability, lifecycle management, production readiness

This release introduces **graceful shutdown support** for background eviction workers, eliminating goroutine leaks and preparing the cache for real-world deployment scenarios such as CI pipelines, containers, and controlled application shutdowns.

##  Key Features

###  Graceful Eviction Shutdown
- Background eviction goroutine now listens for a shutdown signal.
- Controlled termination via a dedicated stop channel.
- Prevents runaway goroutines and resource leaks.

###  Lifecycle Ownership
- Cache instance explicitly owns the lifecycle of its background workers.
- Clear startup (`startEviction`) and teardown (`Stop`) boundaries.

###  Production-Safe Concurrency
- Thread-safe eviction using `sync.RWMutex`.
- Safe map mutation under exclusive locks.
- No blocking of foreground cache operations.

---

##  Design Decisions

### Stop Channel Pattern
- Introduced `stop chan struct{}` for shutdown signaling.
- Uses channel close semantics for broadcast signaling.
- Zero-allocation, idiomatic Go approach.

### Ticker-Based Eviction
- Replaced unbounded loops with `time.Ticker`.
- Deterministic eviction intervals.
- Proper cleanup using `defer ticker.Stop()`.

## 🔁 API Changes

###  New Methods

```go
func (c *Cache) Stop()
```
