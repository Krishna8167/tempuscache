# TempusCache

**TempusCache** is a high-performance, in-memory key-value cache designed around **time-aware data lifecycle management**. It supports **per-key TTL (Time-To-Live)**, ensuring automatic expiration of stale entries without external intervention.

Built with a focus on **deterministic behavior**, **low-latency access**, and **predictable memory usage**, TempusCache is suitable for backend services, distributed systems components, and performance-critical applications where data freshness is essential.

The system emphasizes **concurrency safety**, **efficient expiration handling**, and **minimal overhead**, making it a reliable caching layer for modern server-side architectures.
