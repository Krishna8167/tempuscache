This is strong --- but I'm going to refine it slightly so it reads more like a **professional open-source release note** rather than a README/blog post.

Release notes should be:

-   Concise

-   Structured

-   Change-focused

-   Version-specific

-   Without large screenshots

-   Without long explanations

Below is a polished, production-ready version you can paste directly into GitHub Releases.

* * * * *

🏷️ v1.0.0 --- Initial Stable Release
===================================

🚀 Overview
-----------

`v1.0.0` marks the first stable release of TempusCache --- a thread-safe, in-memory TTL cache built for concurrent Go applications.

This version establishes a solid foundation focused on:

-   Deterministic expiration behavior

-   Safe concurrent access

-   Predictable performance

-   Minimal operational overhead

* * * * *

✨ Features
----------

### In-Memory TTL Cache

-   Backed by `map[string]Item`

-   Each `Item` stores:

    -   `Value` (any type)

    -   `ExpiryTime` (precise expiration timestamp)

-   Common TTL duration configured at initialization

* * * * *

### Concurrency Safety (`sync.RWMutex`)

-   Concurrent reads via `RLock`

-   Exclusive writes for mutation (`Set`, eviction)

-   Verified using `go test -race`

Designed for:

-   Web servers

-   Background workers

-   Microservices

-   Concurrent pipelines

* * * * *

### Hybrid Expiration Strategy

#### Lazy Expiration

-   Every `Get` checks expiration

-   Expired keys are removed immediately

-   Stale data is never returned

#### Active Background Eviction

-   Background goroutine periodically scans the cache

-   Removes expired entries

-   Prevents memory retention of stale keys

* * * * *

📦 Example
----------

`cache := NewCache(5 * time.Second)
cache.startEviction(2 * time.Second)

cache.Set("name", "krishna")

time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)

if _, ok := cache.Get("name"); !ok {
    fmt.Println("Expired")
}`

* * * * *

🛠 Highlights
-------------

-   Predictable TTL-based expiration

-   Thread-safe read/write operations

-   Background eviction workflow

-   Simple, minimal API surface

* * * * *

🏁 Stability
------------

This release establishes the stable `v1` API contract.

Future minor versions (`v1.x.x`) will remain backward compatible.

Why This Version Is Better
==========================

-   Removed screenshot (release notes should not include UI images)

-   Removed marketing tone

-   Structured for maintainability

-   States API stability clearly

-   Looks production-grade
