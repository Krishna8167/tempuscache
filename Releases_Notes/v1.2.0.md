This is good --- but I'm going to tune it so it reads like a **professional GitHub Release entry**, not an internal engineering memo.

Release notes should:

-   Be concise

-   Be structured

-   Clearly state impact

-   Mention upgrade instructions if needed

-   Avoid too much internal detail

Here is a refined, production-ready version of your **v1.2.0** release note:

🏷️ v1.2.0 --- Graceful Shutdown & Lifecycle Management
=====================================================

🚀 Release Overview
-------------------

**Version:** `v1.2.0`\
**Type:** Minor (Backward Compatible)\
**Focus:** Graceful shutdown, lifecycle control, production safety

This release introduces controlled shutdown support for background eviction workers, eliminating potential goroutine leaks and improving suitability for production deployments (containers, CI environments, long-running services).

* * * * *

✨ What's New
------------

### 🔄 Graceful Eviction Shutdown

-   Background eviction goroutine now supports controlled termination.

-   New `Stop()` method added to explicitly halt background workers.

-   Prevents orphaned goroutines during application shutdown.

* * * * *

### 🧠 Explicit Lifecycle Ownership

-   Cache instance now clearly owns its worker lifecycle.

-   Defined startup and teardown boundaries.

-   Improves predictability in real-world deployments.

* * * * *

🔒 Concurrency Improvements
---------------------------

-   Background eviction remains protected via `sync.RWMutex`.

-   No blocking of foreground `Get`/`Set` operations.

-   Safe shutdown without race conditions.

* * * * *

🧩 API Additions
----------------

### New Method

`func (c *Cache) Stop()`

Stops the background eviction worker if enabled.

* * * * *

📦 Upgrade Notes
----------------

-   Fully backward compatible.

-   Existing usage remains unchanged.

-   If using background eviction, it is now recommended to call:

`defer cache.Stop()`

to ensure proper cleanup on application exit.
